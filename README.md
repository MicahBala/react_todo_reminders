# Todo Reminders App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). With a guide from Brad Traversy's Crash course on React 2021.

## Using the App

- Clone the project directory and run `yarn add` to install all dependencies
- Open a terminal and run `yarn start` to Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.\
  You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- Open another terminal and run `yarn server` to run the locally installed json server (to mock the backend);
- You can now add and delete tasks from the user interface provided.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
